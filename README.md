> A Vanilla+ pack with a focus on aesthetics.

[**📄 Included mods**](./docs/mods.md)

## Installation
We recommend using the [Prism launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) for playing the pack.

While creating a new instance, you can select the pack after searching for it in the _Modrinth_ tab.

### Additional recommendations
- [`Complementary Shaders`](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders) — highly-configurable shader-pack

## Development
[horizr CLI](https://github.com/horizr/cli) is used for pack management.

### Not from Modrinth
These must be manually updated:
- [`Better Leaves` (resource-pack)](https://github.com/TeamMidnightDust/BetterLeavesPack) v7.1
- [`Towers of the Wild: Reworked` (data-pack)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/towers-of-the-wild-reworked-datapack) v4.0.2+fabric-waystones

### Interoperability entry-points
When new items/blocks/entities/structures are added, the configuration files of the following mods should be adjusted (if necessary).

- Charm: replantable crops, bookcase items, structures on maps
- WTHIT: blacklisted blocks and entities
- Falling Leaves: leaves blocks

### Reconfiguration needed
*None*
